## Far Vision
1. Create a fully functional MMO RPG based on the Naruto Universe
2. Implement all jutsus that appeared in the show
3. Create a character creator based on the Naruto artwork
4. Introduce PVP
5. Create Time-Based events

## PBI Order Rationale
I ordered the PBIs by checking to see the dependencies of each PBI to make sure all the items needed to develop a PBI are present.
I also took into account that there are some PBIs that need to be built right away like the basic character models, actions, and sprinting & parkour because these are basic things that are going to be used by every playable character. Miscellaneous things like the music and login and pause UI were left at the end.
## Ordered Product Backlog

## Worflow
After a story is created and placed in its correct order, we need to start working on it (in progress). If the development team believe that the story is done, the story moves from in progess to needs review. Then, the Product Owner reviews the feature, if he approves it then the development of the feature has concluded, if he rejects the feature then the development team will begin to adjust the feature for the Product Owner to approve it.
